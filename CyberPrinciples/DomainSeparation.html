        <h1>Domain Separation</h1>
        <p>Domain separation is the idea that when it comes to cybersecurity, system segments or "domains" should be kept as apart from each other as possible.
        The "domain" changes depending on the project. It could refer to parts of a network, segments of a program, or components of a computer system. No matter the
        project, the principle applies.</p>
        <p>Take the example of a company network. If the company follows the principle of domain separation, the network should be segmented in some way, such as by department.
        This way, security can be preserved in other departments even if one is compromised. If they didn't follow the principle of domain separation, it would be possible
        to find a weakness in any part of the company network, and use that as an access point to anywhere else in the network. </p>

            <p>Here, an attacker only needs to find one weak point to access the entire network.</p>

            <p>Here, each domain is separate, and would therefore have to be accessed separately.</p>
