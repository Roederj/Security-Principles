            <div id="explainCode">
                <div id="explainDefault"><p>The principle of information hiding dictates that the integrity of a program is better maintained when
                    certain aspects of its implementation are 'hidden,' as in not readily accessible by other developers.</p>
                    <p>A common form of information hiding is an interface -- a collection of functions that are accessible to developers 
                    using the program. The developer cannot interact with internal variables or functions directly; all interaction takes place through
                    the interface. This prevents the developer from unintentionally accessing and changing critical sections of the program. This also, while not a catch-all
                        security solution on its own, helps prevent malicious developers from observing how the program is structured.</p>
                    <p> In the two C++ code snippets to either side, an interface has been enforced through the use of public and private classes. The code snippets 
                    have been implemented without (left) and with (right) good information hiding technique. Hover over the highlighted areas to learn more about 
                    a specific mistake or correction. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="explainBad1"><p>When a variable is made public, it becomes readily accessible to anyone making changes to the program.
                 Changes to critical variables can be made, compromising how the program works.
                 In a security setting, variables containing sensitive information can be easily retrieved.
                    </p></div>
                <div id="explainBad2"><p>As a general rule, as little of a program should be interfaced with as possible.
                    In this case, as little of the program should be made public as possible.
                    Every accessible function is a point through which someone can interact and affect a program.
                    If enough functions are available, it can even be possible to determine the exact inner workings of the program.
                    </p></div>
                <div id="explainGood1"><p>A majority of the program's variables and functions are private.
                    This prevents unintentional handling of variables or the misuse of the functions that directly manipulate them.
                    </p></div>
                <div id="explainGood2"><p>A single function works as the interface to the rest of the program.
                    Making only the absolute necessary functions accessible gives the greatest control over how
                    others interact with the program, and prevents misuse, both accidental and intentional.
                    </p></div>
                <div id="explainGood3"><p>Because less information is accessible, it is more difficult to determine how the program is working behind the scenes.
                    In addition to being more secure, the program is easier for any other programmers to interact with as well.
                    Good information hiding practices help create clean and well-organized interfaces, which make blocks of code easier to use among different programmers.
