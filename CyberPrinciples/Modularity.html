        <h1>Modularity</h1>
        <p>According to the principle of modularity, a program should be written that each functionality of the program is independent and, if possible, reusable
        and interchangeable in other programs. To explain the importantce of modularity, consider the example of a vehicle manufacturing plant. Imagine if each vehicle was 
        custom made. If a customer required a door replaced or engine fixed, a new door would have to be specifically made for the car, and specialized knowledge would be
        required to fix the multitude of engines that would exist. Since vehicles are mass-produced, doors can be easily procured and are guaranteed to fit with no special 
        fitting, providing it is the same kind of vehicle.  </p>

        <p>The navigation menu and main body border are built in a modular fashion. By creating them as modules opposed 
            to rebuilding them for each page, the likeliness that an error will be introduced is reduced.</p>
