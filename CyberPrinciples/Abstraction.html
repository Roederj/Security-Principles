        <h1>Abstraction</h1>
            Abstraction is the act of hiding complex operations under less complex interfaces. One of the most commonplace examples of abstraction is in programming languages
        themselves. To do something as simple as print 'Hello World' in the Assembly language requires intimate manipulation of computer registers, while in the C language
        printing is handled much more neatly with a simple 'printf()' statement. In the background, the same manipulation of registers is occuring. However, the programmer
        has been provided with an interface (the C language, in this case), that prevents incorrect use of the system.
