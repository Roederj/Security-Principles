        <h1>Least Privilege</h1>
        <p>Least privilege is the principle that dictates each part of a program or computer system should only know
        what it needs to know to operate effectively. This ties closely to the concept of domain separation. </p>
        <p>A secondary component of least privilege is that once a task is complete, access to software or networks should be revoked. Consider the example of a contractor 
        brought in to work on a project. To work effectively, they will probably require some access to the internal company network, such as an employee login. Once their work
        is done, least privilege should be preserved by terminating their account and revoking any privileges that were granted to them, ensuring no unnecessary access to the network
        is occurring. </p>
