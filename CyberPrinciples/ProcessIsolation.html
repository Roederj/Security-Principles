        <h1>Process Isolation</h1>
        <p>
            Conceptually, the principle of process isolation is similar to domain separation, the primary difference being that process isolation occurs at a lower level
            than typical domain separation. Each instance of a program running on a computer is a process. Every process running on a computer is assigned space in memory;
            this helps ensure each process operates as it should. 
        </p>
        <p>Ideally, each process should be independent of each other and be unaware of other processes. Properly separating processes helps prevent users from having inappropriate
        access to information in secure applications. An important note on the topic of process isolation is the existence of DLL injections. During a DLL injection, knowledge
        of certain memory spaces can be exploited to force a process to load a dynamic-link library. Code can then be run in the process's memory space to effect a different
        process.  </p>
