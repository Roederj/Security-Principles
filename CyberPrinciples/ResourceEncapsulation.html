        <h1>Resource Encapsulation</h1>
        <p>To encapsulate resources means to package them in such a way that they only work and operate as originally intended. Resource encapsulation is closely tied to 
        information hiding; so closely, in fact, that the two are often mistaken for one another. The main difference is that while infromation hiding refers to the act of
        obscuring how something works, resource encapsulation refers to making something work in a particular way. </p>

            <h1>Explanation</h1>
            <p>Above is an example sample of a hospital database. In a real world setting, a hospital might store records containing sensitive information such as medical details,
            social security numbers, and credit card information. While displaying information as above is by far the easiest way to ensure everyone can see their information,
            the security problems are obvious. To protect patient privacy, records must only be accessed by authorized individuals..</p>

            <h1>Explanation</h1>
            <p>In this simplified example, the table is hidden and information is only accessable if the patient's known. In real world application, such records would be secured by proper means.
            The authorization gives control over how users view the information, giving a better experience on their end and enabling developers to keep sensitive information protected.</p>
