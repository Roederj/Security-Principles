        <h1>Layering</h1>
        <p>Layering is the idea that the best defense is multiple defenses. A network or program becomes more secure as you "layer" authentication factors. For example,
        several websites have instituted 2-factor authentication, requiring users to input their password and then enter a code sent to their email or phone. This layering
        means the account is more secure; to access that particular account, the user must have access to both the password, and the email or phone.</p>
        <p>Something to consider when layering authentication is the balance between security and ease of access. For every extra layer of security added to deter malicious
        users, an extra headache is added for legitimate users. Excessive authentication alone should not be the sole defense against unwanted access. Sensible amounts of
        authentication, paired with other security principles such as least privilege and domain separation, can keep unwanted access to a minimum. </p>
